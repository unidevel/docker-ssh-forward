  -L [bind_address:]port:remote_socket
  -L local_socket:host:hostport
  -L local_socket:remote_socket
          Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the local (client) host are to be forwarded to the given host
          and port, or Unix socket, on the remote side.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to either a TCP port on the local side,
          optionally bound to the specified bind_address, or to a Unix socket.  Whenever a connection is made to the local port or socket,
          the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made to either host port hostport, or the Unix socket
          remote_socket, from the remote machine.

  -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
  -R [bind_address:]port:local_socket
  -R remote_socket:host:hostport
  -R remote_socket:local_socket
  -R [bind_address:]port
          Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded to the local side.

          This works by allocating a socket to listen to either a TCP port or to a Unix socket on the remote side.  Whenever a connection is
          made to this port or Unix socket, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made from the local
          machine to either an explicit destination specified by host port hostport, or local_socket, or, if no explicit destination was
          specified, ssh will act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy and forward connections to the destinations requested by the remote SOCKS client.

  -N      Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just forwarding ports.
